As its name suggests, you can regard it as the beginning of your own journey in the golang ecosystem. Go-Sail will help you start lightly and set sail.  
It helps developers focus on their business without being distracted by other chores. 

## What did Go-Sail do
As the version is updated, it includes but is not limited to: 
- Initializing commonly used components  
- Encapsulating commonly used toolkits  
- Start the http service and listen for system signals  
- Manage request context  
- Unified response format  
- And so on...  

## Conclusion
